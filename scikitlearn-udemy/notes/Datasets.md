# Datasets and Questions
## Enron Backstory
Enron was an energy trading company that collapsed once mass fraud was found. The dataset is one of the most famous, thousands of REAL emails. 

Can we identify patterns in the emails of people commiting fraud? This could potentially be used to predict fraudulent behaviour.

## Person of Interest (POI)
POI; indicated person, settled without admitting guilt, testified in exchange for immunity

## Accuracy vs Training
The larger training set size the more likely the model will be accuracte at predicting.

So few POI (~30) compared to innocent people, that can we properly train a model to accurately predict.
