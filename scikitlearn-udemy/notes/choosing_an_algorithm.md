# Algorithm Choice
K Nearest Neighbour - classic, simple, easy to understand
Adaboost - ensemble methods
Random Forest - ensemble methods

Ensemble Methods; meta classifiers built from many decision trees - multiple classifiers
                  working together to arrive at a single decision.

## Investigation Process
1- Research the algorithm and get a general understanding of what it does.
2- Read the sklearn docs for the algorithm.
3- Deploy the algorithm.
4- Train it.
5- Test it.
6- Determine accuracy.
