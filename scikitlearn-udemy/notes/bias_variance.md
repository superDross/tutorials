## Bias
high bias algorithm; a model that doesn't do anything differently, it ignores the data, no matter how much you train it

high variance algorithm; a model that is extremely perceptive of data such that it can only replicate what it has seen before. It reacts poorly to new data.


paramters are used to alter variance and bias.
